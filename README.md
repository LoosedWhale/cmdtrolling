- SwappingMouseKeys \
Swaps the left and right buttons on the mouse so, when the victim left-clicks, it will be registered as a right click. To reset this, you can go into mouse settings and change it.

- Reset the computer clock \
Reset your computer clock to the start of the century. Not much, but atleast the victim will have to go through all the process of setting the time and date again.

- Hide documents \
Pretty much self-explanatory.

- No close \
Everything the victim closes will magically reappear again. That has to be one of the most funniest cmd pranks ever.

- Crash \
All it does is crash the computer once.

- No more keybord and mouse \
Disables the victim’s keyboard and mouse, so unless they have a touch screen monitor, they’re in some serious trouble.

- Fake Trojan \
This is a safe prank as it does not do anything but scare your friend.

- You have a virus \
Spams virus pop ups

- Shutdown \
Shutdown script that shuts down your pc \
